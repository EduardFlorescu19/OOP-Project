This project is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project developed in C++. 
It consists of multiple phases, each building upon the previous phase to create a comprehensive application. 
The project is designed to showcase various concepts of OOP and demonstrate proficiency in C++ programming.

Phase 1

In Phase 1, the project focuses on implementing the core classes and their functionalities. The requirements for this phase include:

    Defining at least 5 classes related to the project's requirements.
    Each class must contain at least one dynamically managed field using a pointer and at least one statically defined vector.
    Including a class with a static field and a class with a constant field.
    Encapsulating all attributes in the private section of the classes.
    Providing public interfaces (accessor functions) for each attribute, allowing reading and writing of values with validation rules.
    Implementing at least 2 generic methods for processing and displaying attributes in each class.
    Creating 2 parameterized constructors, a copy constructor, a destructor, and an overloaded assignment operator in each class.
    Overloading the input and output operators (>> and <<) for each class.
    Overloading the index operator ([]), at least one mathematical operator (+, -, *, or /), increment and decrement operators (++, --), cast operator (explicit or implicit), negation operator (!), conditional operator (<, >, <=, >=), and equality operator (==) for each class.
    Defining all classes in a single source file.
    Testing the classes by invoking all implemented methods in the main function.
    Phase 1 is considered completed if at least 75% of the requirements are implemented.

Phase 2

Phase 2 extends the project by adding additional features and functionalities. The requirements for this phase include:

    Implementing a module that allows users to save application data into binary files. These data include the contents obtained from text files passed as arguments to the main function or data loaded by users during the working session.
    Managing file entities and file operations through classes (the source code for file access should be encapsulated within new classes added to the project).
    Implementing a module that enables users to generate various reports for the data, displaying them in both the console and text files (at least 3 reports).
    Implementing a simple menu module that allows users to navigate through the application's functions by using numeric keys or entering text.
    Enabling the application to load data from CSV files (comma-separated values) with a separator chosen by the programmer.
    Phase 2 is considered completed if at least 75% of the requirements are implemented.

Phase 3

Phase 3 enhances the project with more advanced concepts and functionalities. The requirements for this phase include:

    Including all the requirements from the previous phases.
    Implementing a class that exemplifies the concept of class composition (if not already implemented in previous phases).
    Extending the existing classes (without modifying them) by deriving new classes and adding new attributes (minimum 2 extensions).
    Implementing at least one abstract class with a minimum of 2 pure virtual methods.
    Implementing at least 2 virtual methods (excluding pure virtual methods).
    Defining a hierarchy of classes using the abstract class or a newly defined or existing base class.
    Implementing a vector of pointers to the base class, managing concrete elements from the class hierarchy.
    Providing a module that allows users to specify the complete path to additional data files. The application reads the data from the indicated file and adds it to the existing data (if not implemented in Phase 2).
    Utilizing at least one vector, set, list, and map from the STL library to manage application data.
    Ensuring the application runs without runtime errors.
